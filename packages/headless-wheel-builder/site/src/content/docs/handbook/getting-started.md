## Installation

Install with pip or uv (recommended for speed):

```bash
pip install headless-wheel-builder

# or with uv
uv pip install headless-wheel-builder

# include all extras (notifications, security scanning, metrics)
pip install headless-wheel-builder[all]
```

## Build your first wheel

### From the current directory

```bash
hwb build .
```

### From a git URL

Pin to a tag, branch, or commit:

```bash
hwb build https://github.com/user/repo@v2.0.0
hwb build https://github.com/user/repo@main
```

### From a tarball

```bash
hwb build ./my-package-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

## Targeting a Python version

Specify which Python version to use for the build:

```bash
hwb build . --python 3.11
```

The default is Python 3.12. Wheels land in `dist/` by default. To build for multiple Python versions, use the GitHub Actions generator (`hwb actions generate`) which produces a build matrix across versions.

## Build isolation

### Virtual environment (default)

Uses uv under the hood for fast dependency resolution:

```bash
hwb build . --isolation venv
```

### Docker

Build inside a manylinux or musllinux container for maximum compatibility:

```bash
hwb build . --isolation docker --image manylinux2014_x86_64
```

Docker isolation ensures your wheels work on any Linux distribution without surprises.

## Configuration

Add a `[tool.hwb]` section to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.hwb]
python = "3.12"
output-dir = "dist"

[tool.hwb.build]
sdist = true
checksum = true
```

Command-line flags always override configuration file values.
