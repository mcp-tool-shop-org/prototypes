Headless Wheel Builder replaces a patchwork of build scripts, release tooling, and CI glue with a single CLI. Build wheels from local paths, git URLs, or tarballs. Draft releases with multi-stage approval workflows. Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities. Generate changelogs. Publish everywhere.

## What you will find here

- **[Getting Started](getting-started/)** — Install, build your first wheel, configure multi-platform builds.
- **[Release Management](release-management/)** — Draft releases, approval workflows, rollback, changelog generation.
- **[CLI Reference](cli-reference/)** — Every command at a glance.
- **[DevOps](devops/)** — Pipelines, GitHub Actions, multi-repo operations, notifications, metrics.
- **[Security](security/)** — Vulnerability scanning, code analysis, license compliance, dependency analysis.
- **[Beginners](beginners/)** — New to Python packaging? Start here.

## Why one tool?

Most Python packaging workflows involve a fragile chain: a build backend, a separate publisher, a changelog generator, a release manager, maybe a security scanner. When something breaks, you are debugging five tools at once.

Headless Wheel Builder unifies the entire wheel lifecycle — from source to shipped — into a single, headless CLI that works identically on your laptop and in CI.
