## Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK
- Windows (MAUI host is Windows-first, targets `net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0`)
- Visual Studio recommended for the MAUI host project

## Build the simulation library

```bash
dotnet build src/MouseTrainer.Simulation/
```

The library builds with `TreatWarningsAsErrors` enabled — zero warnings allowed.

## Run the tests

```bash
dotnet test tests/MouseTrainer.Tests/
```

All 296 tests cover six categories:

| Category | What it tests |
|----------|--------------|
| Architecture | Dependency boundary enforcement |
| Determinism | Replay regression, RNG, session controller |
| Levels | Generator extraction |
| Mutators | Blueprint mutator correctness + composition |
| Persistence | Session store |
| Runs | RunDescriptor golden hashes + identity |

## Run the MAUI host

The MAUI host is the composition root that wires everything together. Use Visual Studio with the startup project set to `MouseTrainer.MauiHost`.
