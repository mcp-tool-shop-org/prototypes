## A. Security Baseline

- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (report email, supported versions, response timeline)
- [x] `[all]` README includes threat model paragraph (data touched, data NOT touched, permissions required)

- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server

## B. Error Handling

- [x] `[all]` Errors follow the Structured Error Shape: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `cause?`, `retryable?` — .NET exception hierarchy

- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI tool
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server

- [ ] `[complex]` SKIP: not complex enough to warrant HANDBOOK

## D. Shipping Hygiene
