## [1.1.2] — 2026-02-27

### Added

- Shipcheck audit — SHIP_GATE.md, SCORECARD.md, root SECURITY.md
- Security & Data Scope section in README

## [1.0.2] — 2026-02-23

### Changed
- **CI**: Consolidated workflow files and hardened pipeline.
- **Docs**: Added GitHub Pages landing page (`docs/index.md`).
- **Dependencies**: Bumped `actions/upload-artifact` to v6.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- Release workflow pnpm version conflict — `pnpm/action-setup@v4` now reads `packageManager` from package.json instead of hardcoded version.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-02-14

### Added
- API stability documentation (`docs/api-stability.md`) — public vs internal API surface, stability guarantees, versioning policy.
- Stability section in README with link to API stability doc and SECURITY.md.
- Identity line in README: "ThrottleAI is a zero-dependency governor for concurrency, rate, and token budgets."

### Changed
- SECURITY.md updated with supported versions table (1.x current, 0.2.x security-only).
- Semver posture: public API is now **stable**. Breaking changes require v2.0.0.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-14

### Added
- `createStatsCollector()` — zero-dependency stats helper for grants, denials, outcomes, and latency tracking. Wire to `onEvent` for instant observability.
- Express adaptive example (`examples/express-adaptive/`) — runnable server with adaptive tuning and load generator showing real-time behavior.
- Tuning cheatsheet (`docs/tuning-cheatsheet.md`) — scenario-based config guide with decision tree and knob reference.
- Troubleshooting guide (`docs/troubleshooting.md`) — answers to common issues: always denied, stalls, adaptive oscillation, dispose behavior, onEvent errors.

### Changed
- README restructured for skimmability: "Choose your limiter" table, adapter telemetry matrix, docs links section.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- Governor `_emit` now catches errors thrown by user-supplied `onEvent` callbacks, preventing a logging crash from taking down the governor.

### Changed
- Upgraded Vitest from 2.x to 4.0.18 (dev tooling only — no public API changes).

### Added
- Compat harness CI workflow (`test-compat.yml`) for safe major-dependency upgrades.
- `scripts/print-vitest-env.mjs` diagnostic helper for CI debugging.
- Vitest upgrade protocol documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Safety-net tests: reaper TTL expiry, `onEvent` error isolation, post-dispose behavior, concurrent mutation (11 new tests, 240 total).

### Security
- Bumped transitive `esbuild` to >=0.25.0 via pnpm override to address GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99 (dev-only).

### Added (repo hygiene)
- `scripts/security-audit.mjs` — run `pnpm audit:prod` / `pnpm audit` locally.
- Weekly security audit CI workflow (`security-audit.yml`) on schedule + `workflow_dispatch`.
- Dependabot groups dev-tool updates into a single weekly PR.
- `packageManager` field pins pnpm version for reproducible installs.
- `scripts/file-size-guard.mjs` — blocks PRs adding files > 1 MB.
- `docs/repo-hygiene.md` — asset policy and history rewrite log.

### Removed
- `logo.png` (2.1 MB) purged from HEAD and all git history via `git filter-repo`.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-02-12

- Fairness tracking with per-actor soft cap and anti-starvation.
- Adaptive concurrency controller (EMA-based).
- Presets: quiet, balanced, aggressive.
- Tree-shakeable adapters: fetch, OpenAI, tools, Express, Hono.
- `withLease` helper with deny / wait / wait-then-deny strategies.
- `formatEvent` and `formatSnapshot` observability utilities.
- `createTestClock` for deterministic testing.
- Strict mode for development safety rails.
