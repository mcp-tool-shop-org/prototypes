# Phase 12 Audit — Release Candidate Discipline (NextLedger)

Phase 12 is about proving **NextLedger** is stable, releasable, supportable, and resilient in real environments — with evidence you can point to later.

Companion docs:

- `docs/PHASE12_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`
- `docs/VERIFY_RELEASE.md`
- `docs/RC_DISCIPLINE_CHECKLIST.md`

## Global Evidence Rule (applies to every commit in Phase 12)

For every Phase 12 commit:

1) Store before/after screenshots in:

- `docs/phase12/screenshots/commit-##/`

2) Update this file (`docs/PHASE12_AUDIT.md`) with:

- what changed
- test evidence
- screenshot links
- any remaining known issues

3) For “soak” commits, add:

- a 30–90 second screen recording (GIF/MP4) showing the flow (store under the same commit folder)

## Evidence types we accept

- `dotnet test -c Release` output (paste summary + counts)
- `dotnet build NextLedger.sln -c Release` output summary
- Manual run evidence from `PHASE5_SANITY_TEST.md`
- Screenshots/GIFs of key UI states
- If a build prerequisite exists (WinUI toolchain), capture it in docs + screenshots

## Commit audit log

> Tip: Replace `TBD` with the actual commit SHA once created.
