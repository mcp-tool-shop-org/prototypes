## What is Artifact?

Artifact runs a freshness driver against any repo and outputs a structured decision packet — tier, format, constraints, hooks, and truth atoms with `file:line` citations. The Curator (local Ollama) drives the decision. If Ollama isn't available, a deterministic fallback produces valid output using inference profiles and seeded rotation.
