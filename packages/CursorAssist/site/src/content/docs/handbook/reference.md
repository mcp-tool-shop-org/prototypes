## NuGet packages

| Package | Depends on | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| CursorAssist.Canon | (nothing) | Versioned immutable schemas and DTOs for motor profiles, assistive configs, difficulty plans |
| CursorAssist.Trace | (nothing) | JSONL trace format (`.castrace.jsonl`) for cursor input recording and playback. Thread-safe. |
| CursorAssist.Policy | Canon | Deterministic mapper from motor profiles to assistive configs (v4 policy) |
| CursorAssist.Engine | Canon, Trace | Input transform pipeline with 60 Hz accumulator, analysis tools, and hash verification |

## CLI tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| CursorAssist.Benchmark.Cli | Replay benchmarking against recorded trace files |
| CursorAssist.Profile.Cli | Motor profiling from raw input data |

## Test coverage

456+ tests across both products:

| Category | What it covers |
|----------|---------------|
| Transforms | SoftDeadzone, Smoothing, PhaseCompensation, DirectionalIntent, TargetMagnetism |
| Pipeline | DeterministicPipeline fixed-step and host-clock modes, hash chains |
| Policy | ProfileToConfigMapper v4: frequency mapping, deadzone formulas, phase comp |
| Analysis | TremorAnalyzer frequency estimation, CalibrationSession, confidence scoring |
| Runtime | EngineThread config swap, echo guard, delta clamping, emergency stop |
| Canon | Schema validation, motor profile and assistive config DTOs |
| Trace | TraceWriter/TraceReader serialization, header format |
| Architecture | Dependency boundary enforcement |
| Determinism | Replay regression, RNG, session controller |
| Levels | Generator extraction |
| Mutators | Blueprint mutator correctness and composition |
| Persistence | Session store |
| Replay | Serializer, recorder, verifier, quantization |

## Security and data scope

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Data accessed | Raw pointer input coordinates, motor profile JSON, trace recordings, MAUI local storage |
| Data NOT accessed | No cloud sync, no telemetry, no analytics, no network calls, no authentication |
| Permissions | Raw pointer input (Windows hooks), file system for profiles and traces. No elevated permissions. |
