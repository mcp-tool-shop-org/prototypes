    description:
      "Scott Joplin's most famous rag, immortalized by the 1973 film 'The Sting'. The main theme features that unforgettable syncopated melody over a steady left-hand stride. This simplified version captures the essential hook — the bouncy, playful character that makes everyone smile.",
    structure: "Main theme A section (8 bars)",
    keyMoments: [
      "Bar 1: The iconic pickup and opening — everyone recognizes this instantly",
      "Bars 3-4: The melody leaps up and syncopates — this is the fun part",
      "Bars 7-8: The phrase repeats with a slight variation and resolves",
    ],
    teachingGoals: [
      "Syncopated melody over steady bass — hand independence",
      "Grace notes and ornamental playing for character",
      "Ragtime left-hand pattern: bass note on 1-3, chord on 2-4",
    ],
    styleTips: [
      "Playful and precise — ragtime is NOT fast. Joplin wrote 'Not Fast' on his scores.",
      "Left hand absolutely steady: bass-chord-bass-chord",
      "Right hand syncopation should feel cheeky, not rushed",
    ],
