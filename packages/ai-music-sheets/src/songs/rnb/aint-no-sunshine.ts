    description:
      "Bill Withers' soul masterpiece built on a haunting minor-key vamp. The melody is almost entirely stepwise motion over Am-Em-G-Am, making it one of the most approachable R&B songs for beginners. The emotional weight comes from the repetition and the minor tonality, not from complexity.",
    structure: "Verse vamp: Am-Em-G-Am repeated (8 bars)",
    keyMoments: [
      "Bars 1-2: Am to Em — the core vamp. The melody clings to A and B.",
      "Bars 3-4: G to Am — the IV-i movement. This is where the ache lives.",
      "Bars 5-8: Repeat — the repetition IS the point. Let it hypnotize.",
    ],
    teachingGoals: [
      "Minor key feel — understanding how Am sounds different from C",
      "Simple left-hand chord patterns with minimal movement",
      "Expressive melody playing with dynamic control",
    ],
    styleTips: [
      "Slow and soulful — never rush this song",
      "The melody should sound like someone talking, not performing",
      "Left hand: very simple, just grounding chords. Don't overplay.",
    ],
