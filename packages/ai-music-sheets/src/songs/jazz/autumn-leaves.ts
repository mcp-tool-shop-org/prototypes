    description:
      "The quintessential jazz standard for learning ii-V-I progressions. The A section descends through the circle of fifths in G major (Cm7-F7-BbM7-EbM7), then the B section mirrors the same motion in E minor. Every jazz musician knows this tune — it's the 'Hello World' of jazz harmony.",
    structure: "AABA — 32 bars (this excerpt: first A section, 8 bars)",
    keyMoments: [
      "Bars 1-2: Cm7 to F7 — the ii-V in Bb major. Feel the pull toward resolution.",
      "Bars 3-4: BbMaj7 to EbMaj7 — arrival, then the IV chord adds color",
      "Bars 5-8: Am7b5 to D7 to Gm — the ii-V-i in G minor. The tune 'turns the corner' here.",
    ],
    teachingGoals: [
      "ii-V-I voice leading — the smoothest path between chords",
      "Swing eighth notes — long-short feel, not straight",
      "Left-hand shell voicings: root + 7th (or 3rd + 7th) for each chord",
    ],
    styleTips: [
      "Swing feel — triplet-based eighths, emphasis on beats 2 and 4",
      "Melody in the right hand should be legato and vocal",
      "Left hand: keep shell voicings in the middle register, not too low",
    ],
