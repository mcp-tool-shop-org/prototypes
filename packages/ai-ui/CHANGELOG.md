# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.6] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- `env-check` command — reports Node version, config, Playwright, AI models, output/memory directories

### Fixed
- `--version` flag now reads from package.json dynamically (was hardcoded at 1.1.0)

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-19

### Changed
- Pin all GitHub Actions in pages.yml to commit SHAs for supply chain security

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-06

### Added
- **ai-suggest** — semantic feature→trigger matching via local Ollama (Brain role)
- **ai-eyes** — visual surface enrichment via LLaVA vision model (Eyes role)
- **ai-hands** — PR-ready patch generation via qwen2.5-coder (Hands role)
- Four task types for ai-hands: `add-aiui-hooks`, `surface-settings`, `goal-hooks`, `copy-fix`
- Deterministic edit ranking — five-signal trust scoring (validation, anchor, locality, provenance, safety)
- Ranked output: High (≥0.75) / Medium (0.50–0.74) / Low (<0.50) confidence buckets
- Stable sort invariant: validated edits always appear before proposal-only edits
- ⚠️ risk indicators visible even within High confidence bucket
- `--min-rank <n>` flag to suppress low-confidence edits
- `--model`, `--min-confidence`, `--eyes`, `--repo`, `--tasks` flags for AI commands
- Eyes-enriched context for downstream ai-suggest and ai-hands

### Changed
- Pipeline diagram now includes AI commands: `ai-suggest → ai-eyes → ai-hands`
- Test count: 772 → 877

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-06

### Added
- Goal rules system (Stage 0E) — configurable effect predicates for SPA task success
- `evaluateGoalRules()` engine with storageWrite, fetch, domEffect, composite matchers
- Three-tier goal detection: route → rule → legacy effect (backward compat)
- Per-step `goals_hit` + per-flow `goals_reached` with score aggregation
- `data-aiui-goal` DOM convention for stable goal markers
- `hasRuntimeEvidence()` to distinguish "not reached" from "unknown"
- Atlas-level feature dedup (matchScore >= 0.7 merges near-duplicates)
- `documented_non_surface` category separates architectural capabilities from must-surface
- Effect-based goal detection for SPAs (storageWrite, domEffect, fetch)

## [1.0.0] — 2026-02-28

### Added
- 20-command CLI: atlas, probe, surfaces, diff, graph, compose, verify, baseline, pr-comment, init-memory, runtime-effects, runtime-coverage, replay-pack, replay-diff, design-map, stage0
- Trigger graph with runtime effect augmentation
- Design-map: surface inventory, feature map, task flows, IA proposal
- CI coverage gates with set-based ratchet
- Replay packs for reproducible artifact snapshots
- 772 tests using Node.js native test runner
