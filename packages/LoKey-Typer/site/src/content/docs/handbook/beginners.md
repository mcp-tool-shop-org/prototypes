This page is for people who have just installed LoKey Typer and want to know how to get the most out of it.

## 1. First launch

When you open LoKey Typer for the first time, you land on the home screen. There are no accounts to create and no setup wizards. Pick a mode and start typing. Focus mode is the recommended starting point -- it uses calm, short exercises designed for building rhythm.

All your data stays on your device in browser localStorage. Nothing is sent anywhere.

## 2. Choosing a practice mode

LoKey Typer has four practice modes. Each one serves a different purpose:

- **Focus** -- Short, calm exercises for building rhythm and accuracy. The HUD is minimal by default, and live WPM is hidden so you can concentrate on the text. This is the best mode for beginners.
- **Real-Life** -- Exercises based on emails, code snippets, and everyday text. Use this when you want to practice the kind of typing you actually do at work.
- **Competitive** -- Timed sprints (30s, 60s, or 120s) with personal bests. Live WPM is shown by default. Use this when you want to measure your speed.
- **Daily Set** -- A fresh set of exercises generated each day, adapted to your recent sessions. The set stays the same all day, so you can return to it anytime.

If you are unsure, start with Focus. You can switch modes at any time from the home screen.

## 3. Understanding the typing screen

During a typing session, you see the target text and your typed input. Characters you type correctly appear as expected. Errors are highlighted so you can see where you went wrong.

Key metrics shown after a run:

- **WPM** (words per minute) -- Calculated as correct characters divided by 5, divided by elapsed minutes.
- **Accuracy** -- The ratio of correct characters to total characters typed. A perfect run is 100%.
- **Errors** -- The count of incorrect characters.
- **Backspaces** -- How many times you pressed backspace to correct mistakes.

Personal bests are recorded only when your accuracy is 95% or above. This encourages clean typing over raw speed.

## 4. Settings and preferences

Open the settings panel from any mode page to adjust:

- **Sound** -- Toggle keystroke audio on or off. Adjust volume.
- **Ambient sound** -- Enable or disable ambient soundscapes. Choose a category (Rain, Forest, Ocean, and 8 others) or leave it on All. Adjust ambient volume separately.
- **Font scale** -- Choose 90%, 100%, or 110% text size.
- **Live WPM** -- Show or hide the live WPM counter per mode.
- **Sprint duration** (Competitive only) -- 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or 120 seconds.
- **Ghost indicator** (Competitive only) -- Shows your pace relative to your personal best.
- **Screen Reader Mode** -- Disables ambient sound and filters exercises for screen reader compatibility.
- **Reduced Motion** -- Disables ambient macro evolution (subtle environmental changes over time).

All settings are saved locally and persist between sessions.

## 5. How personalization works

After a few runs, LoKey Typer starts adapting to you. It tracks your WPM, accuracy, and error patterns using a local skill model. This model determines which exercises the app recommends and how the Daily Set is assembled.

The personalization is subtle:

- Exercises near your current difficulty level are preferred.
- If you consistently struggle with certain character types (punctuation, brackets, numbers), exercises targeting those areas get a small weight boost.
- Recently completed exercises are deprioritized so you see fresh content.

You do not need to do anything to activate personalization. It happens automatically based on your runs. You can also ignore it entirely and pick exercises manually.

For full details, see the [Personalization](/LoKey-Typer/handbook/personalization/) page.

## 6. Tips for getting started

- **Start with Focus mode.** It is designed for calm, low-pressure practice.
- **Do not chase WPM.** Accuracy matters more, especially early on. Personal bests require 95% accuracy.
- **Try ambient sound.** The soundscapes are designed to fade into the background and help sustain focus during longer sessions.
- **Use Daily Set for variety.** It picks a balanced mix of exercises so you do not have to decide what to practice.
- **Take breaks.** LoKey Typer is built for extended sessions, but there is no pressure to keep going. Close the app and come back whenever you want.
- **Check your feedback.** After each run, you get a short, calm summary of how it went. In Competitive mode, the feedback is more direct.
