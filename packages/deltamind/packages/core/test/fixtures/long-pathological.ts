  turns: [
    // Phase 1: Vague start with speculation
    { turnId: "t-1", role: "user", content: "I'm building an ML inference pipeline. Probably going to use Python." },
    { turnId: "t-2", role: "assistant", content: "Python is the standard for ML. What framework? PyTorch, TensorFlow, or ONNX Runtime?" },
    { turnId: "t-3", role: "user", content: "PyTorch I think. Or maybe ONNX for production. I'm not sure which is better for our case." },
    { turnId: "t-4", role: "assistant", content: "PyTorch for flexibility, ONNX for production performance. You could develop in PyTorch and export to ONNX." },
    { turnId: "t-5", role: "user", content: "Yeah that sounds right. Let's do PyTorch for now and figure out ONNX later." },
    // Phase 2: Constraint introduction with hedging
    { turnId: "t-6", role: "user", content: "Latency should be under 100ms per inference. That's probably important." },
    { turnId: "t-7", role: "assistant", content: "100ms latency target. Is that a hard requirement or a goal?" },
    { turnId: "t-8", role: "user", content: "Hard requirement. The API gateway has a 200ms timeout and we need room for network overhead." },
    { turnId: "t-9", role: "user", content: "Oh and the model needs to run on GPU. We have A100s in production." },
    { turnId: "t-10", role: "assistant", content: "GPU inference on A100s with sub-100ms latency. Got it." },
    // Phase 3: First task, immediately complicated
    { turnId: "t-11", role: "user", content: "Start with the model loading pipeline. Load the model, warm it up, serve requests." },
    { turnId: "t-12", role: "assistant", content: "Working on model loader. Loading weights, moving to GPU, running warmup inference." },
    { turnId: "t-13", role: "assistant", content: "Model loader done. Loads from disk, moves to CUDA, runs 10 warmup inferences." },
    { turnId: "t-14", role: "user", content: "Wait, we might need to load multiple models. Like, an ensemble. Or maybe just one. I haven't decided." },
    { turnId: "t-15", role: "assistant", content: "I'll make the loader support multiple models. Easy to restrict to one later." },
    // Phase 4: Duplicate decisions with different wording
    { turnId: "t-16", role: "user", content: "The API should be FastAPI. It's the fastest Python web framework." },
    { turnId: "t-17", role: "assistant", content: "FastAPI for the API layer. Good choice — async support and automatic OpenAPI docs." },
    { turnId: "t-18", role: "user", content: "For the web server, we need something fast and async. Let's use FastAPI." },
    { turnId: "t-19", role: "assistant", content: "Already set up with FastAPI. We're aligned." },
    // Phase 5: Batching — major branch with twists
    { turnId: "t-20", role: "user", content: "Should we batch inference requests? Batching would improve throughput." },
    { turnId: "t-21", role: "assistant", content: "Dynamic batching is great for throughput. But it adds latency for individual requests since you wait for the batch to fill." },
    { turnId: "t-22", role: "user", content: "True. Let's skip batching for now and add it if we need throughput." },
    { turnId: "t-23", role: "user", content: "Actually, wait. The PM says we'll have 500 concurrent users. We definitely need batching." },
    { turnId: "t-24", role: "assistant", content: "500 concurrent users changes things. Dynamic batching with a short timeout (e.g., 5ms) would help throughput without killing latency." },
    { turnId: "t-25", role: "user", content: "OK let's do dynamic batching. Max batch size 32, timeout 5ms." },
    // Phase 6: Preprocessing — constraint that gets stale
    { turnId: "t-26", role: "user", content: "Input preprocessing must happen on CPU to keep GPU free for inference only." },
    { turnId: "t-27", role: "assistant", content: "CPU preprocessing, GPU inference. Clean separation." },
    { turnId: "t-28", role: "assistant", content: "Preprocessing pipeline done: tokenization, normalization, tensor creation — all on CPU. Tensors moved to GPU just before inference." },
    // Phase 7: Monitoring — task that gets reopened
    { turnId: "t-29", role: "user", content: "Add Prometheus metrics. Latency p50/p95/p99, throughput, error rate." },
    { turnId: "t-30", role: "assistant", content: "Adding Prometheus metrics endpoint. Histogram for latency, counter for requests/errors." },
    { turnId: "t-31", role: "assistant", content: "Metrics done. /metrics endpoint with latency histograms and request counters." },
    { turnId: "t-32", role: "user", content: "Good. Ship it." },
    { turnId: "t-33", role: "user", content: "Wait — the metrics are wrong. We need to measure batched inference latency separately from per-request latency. Reopen that." },
    { turnId: "t-34", role: "assistant", content: "Reopening metrics. Adding separate histograms: batch_inference_seconds and request_latency_seconds." },
    { turnId: "t-35", role: "assistant", content: "Metrics fixed. Two separate latency histograms plus queue depth gauge for the batching system." },
    // Phase 8: Speculation disguised as fact
    { turnId: "t-36", role: "user", content: "We're going to need model versioning. Like, definitely. Multiple model versions running simultaneously with traffic splitting." },
    { turnId: "t-37", role: "assistant", content: "Model versioning with traffic splitting. That's a significant feature — canary deployments for models." },
    { turnId: "t-38", role: "user", content: "Well, we might. The ML team mentioned it but nothing's been decided. Just keep it in mind." },
    { turnId: "t-39", role: "assistant", content: "Noted as a potential future requirement, not committed." },
    // Phase 9: Reversal on preprocessing constraint
    { turnId: "t-40", role: "user", content: "Actually, some preprocessing steps are heavy — like image resizing. Let's allow GPU preprocessing for image models." },
    { turnId: "t-41", role: "assistant", content: "Revising the CPU-only preprocessing constraint. GPU preprocessing allowed for compute-heavy operations like image transforms." },
    // Phase 10: Caching debate
    { turnId: "t-42", role: "user", content: "Should we cache inference results?" },
    { turnId: "t-43", role: "assistant", content: "Depends on the input space. If inputs repeat frequently, caching saves GPU cycles. If they're unique, cache hit rate will be near zero." },
    { turnId: "t-44", role: "user", content: "Our inputs don't repeat much. Skip caching." },
    { turnId: "t-45", role: "user", content: "Hmm, actually, some customers send the same request multiple times. Maybe we should cache after all." },
    { turnId: "t-46", role: "user", content: "You know what, let's add a simple LRU cache. If it doesn't help we'll remove it." },
    { turnId: "t-47", role: "assistant", content: "LRU cache with configurable size. Easy to disable if hit rate is low." },
    // Phase 11: Health checks and graceful shutdown
    { turnId: "t-48", role: "user", content: "We need health checks. Readiness should verify the model is loaded and warm." },
    { turnId: "t-49", role: "assistant", content: "Health checks: /health/live (process alive), /health/ready (model loaded + warmed up)." },
    { turnId: "t-50", role: "user", content: "Add graceful shutdown. Drain the batch queue before stopping." },
    { turnId: "t-51", role: "assistant", content: "Graceful shutdown: stop accepting new requests, drain batch queue, then exit." },
    // Phase 12: Late-stage ONNX question resurfaces
    { turnId: "t-52", role: "user", content: "The ML team just tested ONNX export. Latency drops from 45ms to 18ms. Should we switch to ONNX now?" },
    { turnId: "t-53", role: "assistant", content: "18ms is a huge improvement. ONNX Runtime with CUDA execution provider would be a significant win. But it limits dynamic model features." },
    { turnId: "t-54", role: "user", content: "Let's switch to ONNX Runtime. The performance gain is too big to ignore." },
    // Phase 13: Testing
    { turnId: "t-55", role: "user", content: "Write tests. Integration tests for the API, unit tests for preprocessing, load tests for latency." },
    { turnId: "t-56", role: "assistant", content: "Test suite: pytest for unit/integration, locust for load testing. Testing all endpoints with mock model." },
    { turnId: "t-57", role: "assistant", content: "Tests done. 28 unit tests, 15 integration tests, load test confirming sub-100ms p99 under 500 concurrent users." },
    { turnId: "t-58", role: "user", content: "Perfect. This is ready for staging deployment." },
