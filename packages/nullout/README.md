MCP server that finds and safely removes "undeletable" files on Windows.

Windows reserves device names like `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`-`COM9`, and `LPT1`-`LPT9` at the Win32 layer. Files with these names can exist on NTFS (created via WSL, Linux tools, or low-level APIs) but become impossible to rename, move, or delete through Explorer or normal shell commands. NullOut also detects files with trailing dots or spaces and paths exceeding the Win32 MAX_PATH limit (260 characters).

NullOut scans for these hazardous entries and removes them safely using the `\\?\` extended path namespace, with a three-step scan-plan-delete workflow designed for MCP hosts.

## Install

```bash
pip install nullout-mcp
```

Requires Windows 10/11 and Python 3.10+.

## How it works

1. **Scan** an allowlisted directory for reserved-name collisions, trailing dots/spaces, and overlong paths
2. **Plan** the cleanup — NullOut generates a per-entry confirmation token bound to the file's identity (volume serial + file ID)
3. **Delete** with the token — NullOut re-verifies the file hasn't changed (TOCTOU protection) before removing it via extended namespace

## Safety model

- **Allowlisted roots only** — operations are confined to directories you explicitly configure
- **No raw paths in destructive calls** — delete accepts only server-issued finding IDs + confirmation tokens
- **deny_all reparse policy** — junctions, symlinks, and mount points are never traversed or deleted
- **File identity binding** — tokens are HMAC-signed and bound to volume serial + file ID; any change between scan and delete is rejected
- **Empty-only directories** — v1 refuses to delete non-empty directories
- **Structured errors** — every failure returns a machine-readable code with next-step suggestions

## MCP tools

| Tool | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `list_allowed_roots` | read-only | Show configured scan roots |
| `scan_reserved_names` | read-only | Find hazardous entries in a root |
| `get_finding` | read-only | Get full details for a finding |
| `plan_cleanup` | read-only | Generate deletion plan with confirmation tokens |
| `delete_entry` | destructive | Delete a file or empty directory (requires token) |
| `who_is_using` | read-only | Identify processes locking a file (Restart Manager) |
| `get_server_info` | read-only | Server metadata, policies, and capabilities |

## Quick start

```bash
nullout-mcp          # start the stdio JSON-RPC server
nullout-mcp --version  # print version and exit
```

## Configuration

Set allowlisted roots via environment variable:

```
NULLOUT_ROOTS=C:\Users\me\Downloads;C:\temp\cleanup
```

Token signing secret (generate a random value):

```
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

```
NULLOUT_TOKEN_SECRET=<paste the output here>
```

Both variables are required. The server refuses to start without them.

## Threat model

NullOut defends against:

- **Destructive misuse** — delete requires a server-issued confirmation token; no raw paths accepted
- **Path traversal** — all operations confined to allowlisted roots; `..` escapes are resolved and rejected
- **Reparse point escapes** — junctions, symlinks, and mount points are never traversed or deleted (`deny_all`)
- **TOCTOU races** — tokens are HMAC-bound to volume serial + file ID; any identity change between scan and delete is rejected
- **Namespace tricks** — destructive operations use `\\?\` extended path prefix to bypass Win32 name parsing
- **Locked files** — Restart Manager attribution is read-only; NullOut never kills processes
- **Non-empty directories** — refused by policy; only empty directories can be deleted

**Data touched:** filesystem metadata (names, file IDs, volume serials), process metadata (PIDs, app names via Restart Manager).
**Data NOT touched:** file contents, network, credentials, Windows registry.
**No telemetry** is collected or sent.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.10+
