## What is NullOut?

Windows reserves device names like `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`-`COM9`, and `LPT1`-`LPT9` at the Win32 layer. Files with these names can exist on NTFS (created via WSL, Linux tools, or low-level APIs) but become impossible to rename, move, or delete through Explorer or normal shell commands.

NullOut is an MCP server that scans for these hazardous entries and removes them safely using the `\\?\` extended path namespace, with a two-phase confirmation workflow.
