# MCP Voice Engine

Deterministic, streaming-first prosody engine for expressive voice synthesis, pitch control, and real-time voice transformation.

## Why this exists

Most voice DSP systems fail in two places: **stability** (warble, jitter, note flutter) and **reproducibility** (“it only happens sometimes”). MCP Voice Engine is built to be musical, causal, and deterministic—so it behaves like software, not folklore.

## What you can build with it

*   **Real-time voice stylization** for games and interactive apps (stable targets, expressive controls)
*   **Streaming voice pipelines** (servers, bots, live processing)
*   **DAW / toolchain integration** (deterministic pitch targets, consistent render behavior)
*   **Web Audio demos** (AudioWorklet-ready architecture)

## Quickstart

```bash
npm i
npm run build
npm test
```

## Core capabilities

### Deterministic output
Same input + config (and chunking policy) produces the same output, with regression protection via hash-based tests.

### Streaming-first runtime
Stateful, causal processing designed for low latency. No retroactive edits. Snapshot/restore supported for persistence and resumability.

### Expressive prosody controls
Event-driven accents and boundary tones let you shape cadence and intonation intentionally—without destabilizing pitch targets.

### Meaning tests (semantic guardrails)
The test suite enforces communicative behavior, including:
*   **accent locality** (no “smear”)
*   **question vs statement boundaries** (rise vs fall)
*   **post-focus compression** (focus has consequences)
*   **deterministic event ordering**
*   **style monotonicity** (expressive > neutral > flat without increasing instability)
