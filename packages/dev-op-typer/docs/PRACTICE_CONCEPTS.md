# Practice Concepts (v0.3.0)

This document describes what the DevOpTyper system can represent for deliberate practice. It defines **capabilities**, not prescriptions. Nothing here is mandatory.

## Core Principle

> v0.3.0 helps developers practice typing code deliberately over time.

If a concept doesn't support that sentence, it doesn't belong here.

## Session Context

Every typing session can carry optional metadata describing **why** it happened.

### Intent

A session may have an intent:

| Intent | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Freeform` | No particular reason. Just practicing. |
| `WeaknessTarget` | Targeting a specific weak character, group, or topic. |
| `Repeat` | Repeating a previously completed snippet. |
| `Exploration` | Trying a new language or difficulty level. |
| `Warmup` | Short, easy practice to get started. |

Intent is always optional. A session with no intent is perfectly valid.

### Focus

A session may focus on something specific:
- A character group (e.g., `"brackets"`)
- A language topic (e.g., `"python:list_comprehensions"`)
- A weakness (e.g., the character `{`)

Focus is a free-form string. The system does not validate or enforce it.

### Group Tag

Sessions may share a group tag for loose association. Group tags are strings — there is no enforced hierarchy, sequence, or structure.

Example: three sessions tagged `"morning-warmup"` are related by the user's intent, not by the system's rules.

## Longitudinal Data

The system accumulates data across sessions without interpreting it.

### Language Trends

For each language, the system stores:
- **Recent WPM values** (last 50 sessions)
- **Recent accuracy values** (last 50 sessions)
- **Session count** and **first/last session dates**

These are raw numbers. The system computes averages but does not judge them.

### Session Cadence

The system records when sessions happen (timestamps only). This enables:
- Detecting practice frequency without enforcing it
- Identifying gaps without shaming
- Observing fatigue patterns without blocking

### Weakness Snapshots

Once per day per language, the system captures a snapshot of the user's weakest characters. Over time, these snapshots reveal:
- Which weaknesses persist
- Which weaknesses resolve
- Whether the user's weak spots are changing

Snapshots are observations, not evaluations.

## Reflection (v0.4.0)

v0.4.0 adds optional reflective capabilities. These exist for users who find them helpful. They are never required, never prompted, and never gate any feature.

### Declared Intent

Users can optionally label sessions with a declared intent:

| Intent | What the user is saying |
|---|---|
| `Focus` | "I want to work on something specific." |
| `Challenge` | "I want to stretch myself." |
| `Maintenance` | "I want to stay in shape." |
| `Exploration` | "I want to see what's out there." |

Declared intent is stored with the session. The system never acts on it — no scoring changes, no difficulty adjustments, no snippet selection bias. It exists solely for the user's own retrospective awareness.

### Session Retrospective

After a session completes, the completion banner can show a brief retrospective: WPM/accuracy delta vs recent average, declared intent, difficulty context. This section uses only factual language — no "good," "bad," "improvement," or "regression."

### Session Notes

Users can attach a free-text note to any completed session (max 280 chars). Notes are private, local, unstructured, and never read by the system. They appear in session history with a pencil icon.

### Intent Patterns

The StatsPanel shows a "By Intent" section with factual averages grouped by declared intent. This section only appears when the user has 2+ sessions per intent — it requires deliberate engagement and does not appear unsolicited.

### What reflection does NOT include

- No prompts asking the user to reflect
- No "reflection score" or "consistency tracker"
- No notifications about missed reflections
- No auto-generated insights or interpretations
- No "streak" of consecutive notes or intents
- No comparison of "intent performance" as good or bad

Use if helpful. Ignore if not.

## Guidance vs Instruction (v0.5.0)

v0.5.0 adds orientation cues and session framing. These are **guidance**, not **instruction**.

| Guidance | Instruction |
|---|---|
| Shows what happened before | Tells you what to do next |
| Describes typical ranges | Sets targets or goals |
| Shows context silently | Demands attention |
| Can be missed entirely | Blocks until acknowledged |
| Uses past tense or neutral present | Uses imperative ("you should") |
| Never changes behavior | Gates features or progression |

### Examples of guidance (all v0.5.0 additions)

- "Last session: Binary Search (42 WPM)" — orientation cue
- "Python - ~45 WPM - ~92%" — soft session frame
- "python: 42 - csharp: 18" — language breakdown

None of these are instructions. The app never mandates behavior.

## What the System Deliberately Does Not Do

- **No daily streaks.** The system records when you practice. It does not reward consistency or punish gaps.
- **No mandatory structure.** Practice modes, focuses, and intents exist for users who want them. They are never required.
- **No scoring of trends.** The system stores data points. It does not compute "improvement scores" or "regression alerts."
- **No social comparisons.** All data is local. There are no leaderboards, rankings, or peer comparisons.
- **No cloud sync.** All data lives on the user's machine. Nothing leaves the device.
- **No forced reflection.** Retrospectives, notes, and intents are optional. They never interrupt, gate, or pressure.

## Data Lifecycle

| Data | Retention | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| Session records | Indefinite | 500 most recent |
| Session timestamps | Indefinite | 200 most recent |
| Language trend points | Indefinite | 50 per language |
| Weakness snapshots | Indefinite | 90 most recent |
| Practice context | Per-session | Stored with record |
| Declared intent | Per-session | Stored with record |
| Session notes | Per-session | Stored with record (max 280 chars) |

All data can be exported as JSON. All data can be reset.

## Backward Compatibility

v0.3.0 data additions are designed to coexist with v0.2.0 persisted state:

- **PracticeContext** is nullable on SessionRecord. v0.2.0 sessions have `Context = null`.
- **LongitudinalData** defaults to empty collections. Missing fields deserialize safely via `System.Text.Json` defaults.
- **No schema version bump required.** All new fields use default initializers (`new()`, `null`).
- **SanitizeBlob** null-checks all new fields on load, ensuring corrupt or partial data never crashes the app.
- **No behavior change.** Existing workflows (start, type, complete, next snippet) execute identically with or without v0.3.0 data.

v0.4.0 follows the same pattern:

- **DeclaredIntent** and **Note** on SessionRecord are nullable. Pre-v0.4.0 sessions have both as `null`.
- **Practice preferences** (ShowIntentChips, DefaultIntent, PracticeNote) default to sensible values.
- **No schema version bump required.** All new fields are nullable or have defaults.
- **No behavior change.** v0.3.0 workflows execute identically. Intent markers add data but never alter control flow.

v0.4.0 Phase 4 (Identity) additions:

- **TypistIdentity** is computed on-demand and never persisted. It reads from existing longitudinal data.
- **ShowSuggestions** defaults to `true`. Setting it to `false` hides all suggestions with no side effects.
- **Stale data handling**: When last session is 30+ days old, identity shows a neutral "Last active X ago" label and suppresses consistency metrics.
- **No new persisted fields** in Phase 4. Identity is derived from existing data structures.

## Philosophy

The system exists to **support** deliberate practice, not to **manage** it.

A developer who opens the app, types one snippet, and closes it had a valid session. A developer who practices for two hours with structured focus had a valid session. The system treats both equally.

Randomness remains valid. Structure exists for those who want it. Reflection exists for those who find it useful.
