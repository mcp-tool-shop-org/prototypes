# Limitations

This document describes what clearance-opinion-engine does NOT do. Understanding these boundaries is essential for proper use.

## Not Legal Advice

This engine produces an automated namespace-availability opinion. It is not a trademark search, not a legal opinion, and not a substitute for professional trademark counsel. The output explicitly states this in every report.

## No Trademark Database Checks

The engine does NOT query:

- **USPTO** (United States Patent and Trademark Office)
- **EUIPO** (European Union Intellectual Property Office)
- **WIPO** (World Intellectual Property Organization)
- Any national or regional trademark registry

These require API keys, registration, or paid access and are planned for a future phase.

The **collision radar** feature (`--radar`) searches GitHub and npm for similar names, but these are **indicative market-usage signals**, not trademark searches. A name being unused on GitHub does not mean it is not trademarked, and a name found on GitHub does not constitute a trademark conflict.

The **corpus comparison** feature (`--corpus`) compares against a user-provided list of known marks only. It is not an exhaustive trademark database.

## Domain Coverage

- Domain checks use **RDAP** (RFC 9083) via the `rdap.org` bootstrap service
- Default TLDs: `.com` and `.dev` only
- RDAP covers ~87% of TLDs globally (96% of gTLDs, 53% of ccTLDs)
- Some country-code TLDs may not respond to RDAP queries
- Domain availability is a point-in-time check — registration status can change

## No Social Media Handle Checks

The engine does not check availability of handles on:

- Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn
- YouTube, TikTok, Reddit
- Any social media platform

## No Common-Law Trademark Analysis

The engine does not search for:

- Existing use of the name in commerce (web search)
- App store listings (Apple App Store, Google Play)
- Business name registrations
- DBA filings

The collision radar (`--radar`) provides partial coverage of this gap by searching GitHub repositories and npm packages, but these are indicative signals only and do not cover commerce at large.

## Docker Hub Requires Namespace

Docker Hub checks require a `--dockerNamespace <ns>` flag specifying the Docker Hub user or organization. Without this flag, the Docker Hub channel is skipped with a `COE.DOCKER.NAMESPACE_REQUIRED` warning. Unlike npm or PyPI where package names are globally unique, Docker Hub repositories exist within a namespace (e.g., `myorg/my-tool`).

## Hugging Face Requires Owner

Hugging Face checks require a `--hfOwner <owner>` flag specifying the Hugging Face user or organization. Without this flag, both model and space checks are skipped with `COE.HF.OWNER_REQUIRED`. Hugging Face resources are scoped to an owner (e.g., `myuser/my-model`).

## Fuzzy Variant Scope

- Fuzzy variants use **edit-distance=1 only** (single character deletion, substitution, or insertion)
- Edit-distance=2+ variants are not generated (combinatorial explosion)
- Fuzzy variant registry queries are limited to **npm, PyPI, and crates.io** — not domain, GitHub, Docker Hub, or Hugging Face
- Default variant budget is 12 (configurable via `--variantBudget`, max 30)
- Fuzzy variant matches produce YELLOW opinions, never RED by themselves

## Phonetic Analysis Limitations

- Uses the Metaphone algorithm, which is **English-centric**
- May not detect phonetic similarities in other languages
- Homoglyph detection covers ASCII + Cyrillic + Greek confusables (not all Unicode scripts)
- Does not detect semantic similarity (different words with same meaning)

## DuPont-Lite Analysis Limitations

- The DuPont-Lite analysis is **NOT legal advice** and is not a substitute for a proper trademark likelihood-of-confusion analysis
- Only 4 of the 13 DuPont factors are approximated (similarity of marks, channel overlap, fame proxy, intent proxy)
- Fame proxy uses GitHub/npm star count as a rough proxy -- this is NOT a reliable indicator of trademark fame
- Intent proxy detects typosquatting patterns only -- it cannot determine actual intent
- All scores are algorithmic heuristics, not legal conclusions

## Safer Alternatives Limitations

- Alternative suggestions are heuristic -- they have NOT been checked against trademark databases
- Only 5 strategies are used (prefix, suffix, separator, abbreviation, compound)
- Alternatives are generated from the candidate name only -- they do not consider market positioning or branding
- Even when `--suggest` re-checks alternatives against registries, this only covers namespace availability, NOT trademark clearance
- Short candidate names (<=6 chars) may produce abbreviations that are too short to be useful

## Point-in-Time Checks

All namespace checks are point-in-time snapshots. Between the check and any action you take:

- A namespace could be claimed by someone else
- A previously taken namespace could become available
- Registry policies could change

## Batch Mode Limits

- Maximum 500 names per batch file (safety cap)
- Concurrency defaults to 4 simultaneous checks; higher values increase API rate limit risk
- Per-name errors are captured (not thrown), so one failing name doesn't abort the batch
- Batch determinism requires the same `now` timestamp and identical adapter responses for all names

## Freshness Scope

- Freshness detection compares `check.observedAt` against the current time minus `maxAgeHours`
- Default threshold is 24 hours
- Freshness banners are informational — they do not change the opinion tier
- The refresh command re-runs only stale adapter calls, not the entire pipeline
- If adapter responses change between the original run and refresh, the opinion may change

## Disclaimer and Coverage

Every report includes a disclaimer and coverage score. Important caveats:

- **Coverage ≠ comprehensiveness**: A 100% coverage score means all requested namespace checks returned a definitive answer. It does NOT mean all possible namespaces or trademark databases were checked
- **nextActions are suggestions, not directives**: The coaching output ("Claim now", "Consult an attorney") is generic advice based on the tier — it is not tailored legal or business guidance
- **Disclaimer text is a template**: The disclaimer states what the report is and is not. It is not a substitute for reading and understanding the limitations described here

## Determinism Scope

The determinism guarantee ("same inputs + same adapter responses = byte-identical output") applies only when:

1. The same engine version is used
2. The same adapter responses are provided (via fixture injection or identical network state)
3. The same clock value is injected (or the same `now` parameter is passed)

Different engine versions may produce different output for the same inputs due to scoring algorithm changes, template updates, or new fields.
